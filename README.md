## STEPS:
### 1.	Data Gathering:
        Using Web scraping to collect data from https://www.cardekho.com/
### 2.	Data Preparation
        1.	Data Integration:
                Data comes from several different sources. Data varies in size, type, and structure. Two operations such as joining and appending are performed to combine information from different data sets. Joining tables allows you to combine the information of one observation found in one table with the information that you find in another table. Appending or stacking tables is effectively adding observations from one table to another table.

        2.	Data Cleaning:
                1. Correct Data entry based on our requirements
                2. Remove Duplicate rows and columns to avoid Data Leakage
                3. Fill the Nan values


        3.	Transforming data:
                1.	Feature Selection
                2.	Feature Scaling
                3.	Feature Encoding
### 3. EDA:
    Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the process of performing analysis on data so as 
                1. To Discover patterns
                2. To Spot anomalies, 
                3. To test hypothesis and to check assumptions (this is optional : based on the algorithm we are using we can use this steps)
With the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.
### 4 .Model Building:
    Machine Learning models are created.I try many models.
### 5. Model Evaluation: 
    Once the model are build, the performance of the model is evaluated and pick the best one.
### 6. Model Deployment:
    After testing the model and improving the efficiency, it is deployed on all users
